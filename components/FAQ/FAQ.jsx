          <p>
            Approximately 20 million men in the United States suffer from
            erectile dysfunction (ED). Men with ED have a hard time achieving or
            maintaining an erection long enough to engage in sexual relations
            with their partners. The risk of developing E.D. increases as we get
            older, but it can happen at any age as well.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Several factors can cause erectile dysfunction, including diabetes,
            hypertension, testosterone, and thyroid hormone levels that are
            abnormal, as well as emotional distress.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Having trouble getting or maintaining an erection can be a sign of
            other serious health problems that need to be addressed immediately,
            beyond stress in a relationship and loss of personal confidence. In
            order to identify any additional health concerns that you may have,
            your PureBlue physician will discreetly and comprehensively review
            all your responses to your personal questionnaire.
